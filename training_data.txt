PLEASE HELP  Hi, I am looking for someone who can be my replacement in village 1 (UW residence) for the spring term. I moved out of residence in October 2016 because my family moved to Waterloo. I paid the charges until December 2016. Since then I have been looking for a replacement for my room in village 1 residence. Please help me this is urgent. Because of owing the amount to residence my account is locked, I need to start the spring term which is my coop term. The residence office is insiting to pay for the room that I have never used or to bring a replacement, they rejected the appeal. If someone has already started spring term on residence and wants to help me by becoming my replacement please let me know. I take the full responsibility of paying the balance if there is any. I will be there at residence office and will pay the balance right away, just be my replacement for the room that you are living in for spring term. They are asking me to pay $2500 as room rent, I am expecting with a replacement in any room the balance would be few hundreds or none. Please help me, currently my family is struggling with finances, my mom cannot pay for the room that I have never used. I do not want to discontinue my studies because of money. Please help me and contact me by replying to this message.  Thanks {ROUND TRIP: 0}
